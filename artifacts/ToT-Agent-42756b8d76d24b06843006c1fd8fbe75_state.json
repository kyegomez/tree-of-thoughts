Your primary goal is to ensure the user receives well-structured JSON outputs that align with the tool's requirements.\n\n    ---\n\n    Here is the format you should always follow for your responses involving tool usage:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"<tool_name>\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"param1\": \"<value1>\",\n            \"param2\": \"<value2>\"\n        }\n    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Please proceed with your task accordingly.\n\n    ",

Let's consider a few potential solutions and evaluate them.\\n\\n1. Check if any straightforward combination of multiplication and addition can achieve 24.\\n   - For example, (2 * 8) + (8 / 2) = 16 + 4 = 20. This does not work.\\n\\n2. Try using division to simplify one of the numbers into a factor of 24.\\n   - For instance, 14 - 8 = 6, leaving us with numbers 2, 6, 8. Can these be combined to reach 24?\\n   - (8 / 2) * 6 = 4 * 6 = 24. This works, but we didn't use all numbers correctly.\\n\\n3.
